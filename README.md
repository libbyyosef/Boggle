# Boggle
**Introduction**
This repository contains a simple implementation of the Boggle game using Python and Tkinter. Boggle is a word game where players attempt to find words in sequences of adjacent letters on a grid.

**Project Structure**
The project is organized into several files:

1. **start_window.py:** Contains the StartWindow class responsible for creating the initial window of the game.
2. **game_gui.py:** Contains the GameGui class, which represents the main game window where players can interact with the Boggle board.
3. **boggle_logic.py:** Contains the Boggle class, which manages the game logic, including the Boggle board, scoring, and word validation.
4. **game_ends_window.py:** Contains the GameEnds class, responsible for displaying the end-of-game window with the final score and options to restart or exit the game.
5. **ex12_utils.py:** Utility functions used in the project.
6. boggle_board_randomizer.py: Contains the function for randomizing the Boggle board.
7. **constant.py:** Defines constants used throughout the project.

**Additional Files**
Additional files have been added to enhance the project:

**images/background.png:** Image file used as the background for the StartWindow.
**images/game_over.png:** Image file used as the background for the GameEnds window.
